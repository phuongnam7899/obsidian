# Do we choose desire randomly or freely?
In reality, ==there is only a stream of consciousness==, and ==desires== ==arise and pass== away ==within this stream==, but there is ==no permanent self== that ==owns the desires==, hence it is meaningless to ask whether I choose my desires deterministically, randomly or freely
