# 3. Symmetry Order

-   A design composition should not provide a sense of disorder and imbalance ⇒ Viewers waste time thinking, to fill the imbalance one ⇒ Raise the cognitive load
-   Focus on the message that users need to know / the main problem that they need to deal with, if they need to fix sub-conscious problems ⇒ design has problems

# 4. Similarity

-   To let the brain devote energy to creating relationships between components that look similar
-   Can be similar in color, shape, and size,…
