## Bright background and spaces

- White space is king
- Background should be white or very light
- Use space thoughtful -> clean, fresh
## Subtal roundness on elements

- To look more organic and friendly
- Rounded corners are more pleasure for eyes
- Corner radius should not exceed certain value (except full rounded elements)
## Real-life photography
- Advantage: simply look 'real' and bring a touch of reality to digital products
- Some sources:
	- unsplash.com
## Thoughtfull use of colors

- Save the hightlighted color for the most important actions
-> Reduce cognitive load
## Focus on contrast

- One great thing about Modern Minimal is its accessibility
- With contrast, can easily create visual hierarchy
## Limited uses of effects
- Same as color, save for the most inportant
## Small details, often illustrated

- The use of the graphical elements that weâ€™re all used to using on a daily basis, makes the interface more welcoming, familiar and fun

## Color scheme
- White: should used for background, other colors are not welcome
- Dark grey: Use for main color of all typography (such as #202224) , not use full back color
- Acent color: any color that have enough contrast, and not same as colors that link to certain statuses
## Other
- Photos with shadows made right from the photos themselves are characteristical for the Modern Minimal style

	- Simply duplicate photo, put it underneath, move down and scale down
	- Add gausian blur effect and reduce opacity to ~10%
