# What?
- Principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. 
# Why?
- Designers use the principles to organize content on websites and other interfaces so it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.
# Principle
## **Closure (Reification**)
![[Pasted image 20230212232811.png]]
- We ==prefer complete shapes==, so we ==automatically fill in gaps== between elements to perceive a complete image. Thatâ€™s how we ==can see the whole first==
## Common Region
![[Pasted image 20230212233542.png]]
- We ==group elements== that are ==in the same closed region==
## Figure/Ground (Multi-stability)
![[Pasted image 20230212233730.png]]
- We ==dislike uncertainty==, so we ==look for solid, stable items==
## Proximity (Emergence)
![[Pasted image 20230212233910.png]]
- We ==group closer-together elements==, separating them from those farther apart
