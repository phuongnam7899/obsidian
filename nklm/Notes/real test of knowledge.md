# real test of knowledge
In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto titled The New Instrument. In it he argued that ==‘knowledge is power’==. The ==real test of ‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true==, ==but whether it empowers us==. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge
