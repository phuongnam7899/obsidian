- When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified

# Balance
![[Pasted image 20230212224030.png]]
- Objects in dessign have weight called 'visual weight'
- Visual weight of design should be balance 
- It’s like putting two objects on a seesaw: If one side is too
heavy, the viewer’s eye goes directly to the heavy part
- Balance ==can be implied== by ==size==, ==shape==, or even ==contrast==
- 2 types:
	- Symmetrical
	- Asymmetrical
# Hierarchy
![[Pasted image 20230212224621.png]]
- Is a way to visually rank your design elements.
- A good design leads the eye through each area in priority
order
# Contrast
![[Pasted image 20230212225046.png]]
- The difference between two or more objects in a design is referred to as
contrast
- Different can be:
	- Shape
	- Color
	- Scale/size
	- Layout
- To make element easier to read

# Emphasis
![[Pasted image 20230212225428.png]]
- If contrast deals with the difference between two objects, and emphasis deals with the impact of an object
- Can use contrast to empasize
- To grab view attention
# Scale

- Scale is the sizing of elements or a standard of measurement
# Repeatition
![[Pasted image 20230212230207.png]]
- Is the recurrence of a design element, commonly utilized in
patterns or textures
