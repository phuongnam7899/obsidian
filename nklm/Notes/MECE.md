- MECE structures your thinking with maximum ==clarity== and maximum ==completeness==
- MECE ==starts at== the top level of your solution—==the list of issues== making up the problem you have to solve
- A good issues list contains **2-5 top-line issues** (best is 3)
- If you can’t figure out where to put some ideas, there is always Other Issues, but do not overuse it, and try to avoid put it to top-line issue
