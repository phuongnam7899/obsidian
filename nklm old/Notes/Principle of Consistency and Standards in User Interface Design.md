### Eliminate Confusion
- Users usually use their experience in life when using app, for example: calculator
- Users should not have to spend time wondering whether different words, interactions, or actions actually mean the same thing (example: button with same meaning but diffirent colors)

## How?
###  Choice of language
- Consistent in marketing words and words used in app
-  Language can be word, color, position,...
- When things mean the same or perform the same operation they should be represented in the same way, even in different version (Draft !== Composing mails)
### ### Apply UI Elements as They are Originally Defined
- UI elements that are commonly used, such as  menu bars, icons, scrollbars, and radio buttons, accordion, breadcrumbs, drawer, table,... are graphic elements that are typically consistent and have representations that are widely understood by users
- Example: Checkbox and Radio
### Consider Well-established Conventions When Deciding on Layout
