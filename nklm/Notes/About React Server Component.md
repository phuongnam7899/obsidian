### What?

Can be rendered on the server and on the client.

Give developers more control over what is or isnâ€™t sent to the client

### Compare vs SSR

**SSR:**

-   Taking an application and rendering it to HTML and CSS on the server
-   Fast load
-   Pay the cost to download, to parse, and to execute those components after the initial HTML loads

**React Server Components**

-   Require a re-render from the server every time a network request is made
-   Intelligently merge new data with existing client components
