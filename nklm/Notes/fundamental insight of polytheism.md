# fundamental insight of polytheism

The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the ==supreme power governing the world== is ==devoid of interests and biases==, and therefore it is ==unconcerned== with the human's mundane ==desires==, ==cares== and ==worries==.
