# 4 Rules in UI-UX design
## Place users in control of the interface
### Make actions reversible
### Create an easy-to-navigate interface
- Navigation should always ==be clear== and self-evident
- Good UI puts users in their comfort zone by ==providing== some ==context== of ==where they are==, ==where theyâ€™ve been==, and ==where they can go next== by:
	- Provide ==clues/cues==: Page titles, highlights for currently selected
	- ==Predictability==: Users should be provided with cues that help them predict the result of an action
### Provide informative feedback
- ==For every user action==, the system should show a ==meaningful, clear reaction==. (Example: hover button, error messages, password evaluate,...)
- A system with feedback for every action helps users achieve their goals without friction
- For frequent actions, the ==response can be modest==
### Show the visibility of system status
