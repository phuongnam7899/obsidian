# Did human lived harmonyly with natural
Donâ€™t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, ==Homo sapiens== held the record among all organisms for ==driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions==. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.
