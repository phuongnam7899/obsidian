# What is code formatting
- Improve readability & transport meaning
- 2 types:
	- [[Vertical formatting]]: space between lines, grouping code
	- [[Horizontal formatting]]: Indentation, space between code, line width
- Formatting rules differ between languages => should follow [[language-specific convention]] and guidelines (search "{Language} style guide")
