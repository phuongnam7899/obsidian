# why capitalism defeat communism?

Capitalism did ==not== defeat communism ==because== capitalism was more ==ethical==, because ==individual liberties are sacred== ==or== because ==God was angry== with the heathen communists. ==Rather==, capitalism won the Cold War ==because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing==, at least in periods of accelerating technological change.
