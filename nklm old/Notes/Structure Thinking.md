# Structure Thinking

## Why?

-   Với dự án dài ngày, code tính năng chưa đủ, mà còn cần code được tính năng tiếp theo, tiếp theo nữa,...

## What?

-   Structure: How things are divined, organized and connected

## Mindsets

-   Be your mini-CTO of your code/feature/system:
    -   Take responsibility
    -   Take pride
    -   Craftsmanship spirit:
        -   See code as a product
    -   Design code not only for current feature
-   Be aware of feedback:
    -   Direct feedback
        -   In code review
        -   When another developer update your code give feedback
    -   Indirect feedback:
        -   When it takes longer than estimation
        -   When other people ask many questions about your code
-   Finding opportunities to improve
    -   Refactor: on the go / when leisure / on mistakes
-   Be structurally active, make in your nature
    -   Don't wait until bad
    -   Do before / while / after developing features

## Approaches

-   Divide and conquer
    -   The counter intuition
        -   Every shortcut comes with technical debt
        -   Each function should do only ONE thing
    -   Rules:
        -   Divide as small as possible
            -   Add file and folder > Add code to the folder
        -   Build function by function, module by module,...
-   Data structure first:
    -   Look at DS before anything else (input, output,...)
    -   Design DS before algorithm/logic
    -   Business logic too hard to code ⇒ check DS
    -   Analyze DS ⇒ Design DS ⇒ Implement solution

## Notes/Tips

-   Automation tests really help
-   Good code style help
-   Mind the business logic layer
-   Design patterns help solve the structural problem
-   Dedicate your time to your structure:
    -   In story point
    -   Before push code
-   Be patient, the outcome might not come early
-   Try game dev
