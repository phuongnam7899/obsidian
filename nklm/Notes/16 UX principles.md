- **Meet the users’ needs**
    -   Learn what users are looking for in a design (through user testing and other methods)
    -   ‘U’ in UX does not stand for ‘you’! It’s all about the user,
-   **Know where you are in the design process**
    -   Use different tools
    -   Ask the right questions for user research
-   **Have a clear hierarchy**
    -   How content or information is organized throughout the design
    -   What need to be seen first, then what, then what,...
-   **Keep it consistent**
    -   Similarities with other products that user regularly use → Reduce learning cost → Enhances experience
    -   Also make design process easier
-   **Understand accessibility**
    -   Make sure that the design is usable for as many people as possible
    -   Remove obstacles from the design layout for problem-free navigation
-   **Context is key**
    -   Location, time, emotion state, which device to use, ...
    -   To understand the user’s behavior → better preparation
-   **Usability first**
    -   No matter how nice your design is, it won’t strike a chord with the user unless it is safe and easy to use.
    -   Concentrate on clarity by bringing only useful features to the user’s attention.
    -   Usability testing asks users to interact with the design → notes to see whether they encounter any problems → If many people experience similar problems → make changes to the design
-   **Less is more**
    -   Reduce the operational and cognitive costs
    -   Usability and consistency improve.
-   **Use simple language**
    -   Avoid technical terms and opt for simple language
    -   Factor in five points:
        -   Audience and purpose of the design: question who your audience is, what information they have, what they need, and what they will want to achieve with your communication
        -   Structure: ask about the common structures for your communication, what structures your readers are familiar with, and what sequence will be easy to read
        -   Design layout: focus on the typography, layout, and information graphics
        -   Expression: consider the tone, verbs, sentence length, jargon, and choice of words your communication will adopt
        -   Evaluation: have someone review the text you finalize and conduct a usability test
-   **Feedback matters**
    -   Feedback is a crucial way to encourage communication between humans and machines.
-   **Confirm before you commit**
    -   Accidents happen all the time → Your design should help people correct this
    - To prevent the error
-   **The user is in control**
    -   User control focuses on greater flexibility of use and better control
    -   Examples: "Go to top" button, "Cancel" button, "Undo",...
-   **Design with personality**
    -   Users find it hard to connect with a lifeless design, device, or code.
-   **Visual grammar**
    -   Consists of everything that makes up the visual elements of a design: icons, illustrations, patterns, and more.
    -   Core elements of planes, points, and lines
-   **Narrative design (telling a story with your design)**
