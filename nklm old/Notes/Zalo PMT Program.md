# Product Mindset
## Day 1: Development process
### Pre-reading
1. [Product manager for digital product](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/product-managers-for-the-digital-world)
- Summary: 
	- Product managers are the driving force behind digital products, making decisions about what gets built, how it gets built and launched, and ensuring cross-functional teams are aligned. 
	- Why PM need to be like mini CEO
		- They wear many hats and use a broad knowledge base to make trade-off decisions. 
		- Changes in technology, development methodologies, and consumer behavior. 
		- Companies today have treasure troves of internal and external data and use these to make every product decision.
		- Product managers now function on two speeds: they plan the daily or weekly feature releases, as well as the product road map for the next six to 24 months
		-  [[SaaS]] products become simpler for user => New responsibilities for product managers include overseeing the application programming interface (API) as a product, identifying and owning key partnerships, managing the developer ecosystem, and more.
		- In addition to developers and testers, product-development teams include operations, analytics, design, and product marketers that work closely together in “execution pods”
		- The modern product manager needs to know the customer intimately (through online channels, one-on-one interviews, and shadowing exercises)
	- There are three common profiles of the mini-CEO product manager: technologists, generalists, and business-oriented. 
	 ![[Pasted image 20230130222738.png]]
	- The role of the project manager is fading and the day-to-day engineering execution is typically owned by another role (engineering manager, program manager, or scrum master). 
	- A common theme among product managers is an intense focus on the customer. Differences in how product managers connect with the users
	- The product manager of the future:
		- will be analytics gurus and less reliant on analysts for basic questions
		- will spend at least 30 percent of their time on external activities like engaging with customers and the partner ecosystem
	- Refine PM Function

- Question
	- If  "The role of the project manager is fading and the day-to-day engineering execution is typically owned by another role (engineering manager, program manager, or scrum master)", is that mean PM now mainly work with them, instead of directly with developer?
	- PM = Tech + UX + Biz => Seem that PM strong at 1 of them, and has knowledge on others. Is there any type that is based on UX?
	- If PM is like CEO? Is CEO still needed?
	- More and more decision are data-driven. And AI can do it well also. So in the futute could an PM-AI can replace all PM? Like other AI ike MidJourney, ChatGPT,...
	- Different between softskills and enabler
	- Is there any type of products that need to do "waterfall"?
	- Risk management is on which step?

## Day 2: User Empathy

### Prereading
#### 1. [What Is Empathy and Why Is It So Important in Design Thinking?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-thinking-getting-started-with-empathy)
- Empathy is our ability to **see the world through other people's eyes**
- allows us to **truly uncover and understand** the latent needs and emotions of the people we design for
- allows us to design solutions that meet _all_ three parameters of a successful product or service: desirability, feasibility and viability.

### 2. [Stage 1 in the Design Thinking Process: Empathise with Your Users](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-1-in-the-design-thinking-process-empathise-with-your-users)
- as design thinkers, we should always do our best to leave our own [assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/assumptions "What is Assumptions?") and experiences behind when making observations
- Ask What, How and Why
	- What:  record the details (not assumptions) of what has happened
	- How: analyze how the person is doing what he/she is doing
	- Why: motivations and emotions
- How to?
	- Record/video
	- interview:
- 
		- Prepare the questions first
- Engaging with Extreme Users

-   **[[Service blueprinting]]**
![[Pasted image 20230201210250.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230201211206.png]]
	- Using After customer journey mapping
- ==Order==: Empathy Mapping > Experience map > Customer Journey map -> service blue print
- ==Three-Step Decision Framework==
	-  Current (as-is) vs. future (to-be): do they reflect the current state of the world or a desired state of the world?
	- Hypothesis vs. research: This decision depends on the type of input that you will use to build your mapping.
	- Low-fidelity vs. high-fidelity: quality of the final map visualization
### Questions
- How much should we leave our assumption and experiences behind when observe? What if no judge and ask too much make other people angrey?
