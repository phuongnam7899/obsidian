# Code should be readable like essay: ==top=>bottom without least "jumps"==
- Splitting file with multiple concepts (multiple classes, multiple components,...)
- Different concepts should be separated by spacing (importing area, props area, functions area, effects area,...)
- Similar concepts should NOT be separated
- Related concept should be kept close to other (function A that be used in function B should be declare right after function B, to avoid "jumps")
