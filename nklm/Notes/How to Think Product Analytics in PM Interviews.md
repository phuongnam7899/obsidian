# Summary
### Product management involves using data and analytics to prioritize and execute ideas for improving and adding new features to products, while also considering external factors, industry metrics, and personalization.

-   📊 Product management involves using data and analytics to prioritize, persuade, and execute ideas for improving and adding new features to products.
    -   The speaker discusses his background in technical roles and analytics, and introduces the topic of analytics in product management.
    -   Product management involves ideating, improving, adding new features, and analyzing data, with a focus on analytics and technical aspects such as designing funnels and conducting A/B tests.
    -   Product managers prioritize, persuade, and execute ideas using data and analytics to bring order to the chaos of constant change.
    -   Interviewers want to know if you can identify relevant data, interpret it correctly, use it to persuade others, and be realistic about what data can be collected.
    -   Product managers need to consider the availability and controllability of data when answering questions and should group product analysis into four buckets.
    -   Product managers need to prioritize opportunities, define success metrics, and use analytics to diagnose and improve product performance.
-   💡 Accurately sizing the demand is key to prioritizing features and diagnosing issues when determining whether an idea is worth pursuing.
    -   Opportunity sizing is crucial in determining whether an idea is worth pursuing, and accurately sizing the demand is key to prioritization.
    -   Opportunity sizing involves breaking down five key factors to prioritize features and diagnose issues, while choosing one metric to define success is not recommended.
    -   Clarify scope, identify base population, addressable segments, purchase frequency, and price per use to determine revenue potential.
    -   When considering launching a bicycle-based food delivery service, it is important to analyze the size of the opportunity and the unit economics, as well as ensure alignment with company strategy and consider the design of the service.
    -   When asking for clarifying questions, it's best to make assumptions and ask if they are correct rather than directly asking for data.
    -   The base population is the entire population that can be served with a service, and in this case, the unit of measure is households, with a base population of 320,000 households in Seattle.
-   💡 Use logical reasoning and strong assumptions to identify target segments, determine purchase frequency, and price a product for maximum value.
    -   In product interviews, it's more important to have strong assumptions and logical reasoning rather than precise calculations like in consulting interviews.
    -   To identify target segments, whittle down the base population by considering factors such as affordability and serviceability, and use logical reasoning to determine the addressable segment.
    -   To determine purchase frequency, it is important to pick a reasonable unit of measure and make strong assumptions based on industry data or logical reasoning.
    -   The speaker estimated that 90,000 times per month is how many times people will use their delivery service for food.
    -   When pricing a product, consider competitors and industry standards, as well as the value added by your product compared to the next best option.
    -   The opportunity size for a bicycle delivery service charging $5 per delivery to 30,000 households buying three times a month is estimated to be $5.4 million annually, but further analysis is needed to determine if it is a profitable and viable strategy.
-   🔑 Understanding the funnel is crucial for success in prioritizing metrics and diagnosing issues in seasonality.
    -   Understanding the funnel is key to prioritizing success metrics and diagnosing issues in seasonality, including regional differences.
    -   Understand the rules and inputs of an e-commerce site, including marketing, search engine optimization, and seasonality, to effectively navigate and optimize site visitors.
    -   Quickly identifying inputs and outputs for a service's funnel and designing features to impact them is key for successful product management interviews.
    -   Choose relevant inputs for machine learning algorithms, but avoid complex ones like washing learning if you don't understand it well.
    -   Controlling price is not always profitable, and when considering inputs and features, it's important to integrate them with the company's strategy and customer experience.
    -   Prioritize features based on their impact, such as increasing item detail page views or removing friction at checkout.
-   📈 Prioritize the feature that impacts the most important metric for revenue growth and choose the right metric for A/B testing to accurately measure performance.
    -   Identify the metric that matters and prioritize the feature that impacts it the most for revenue growth.
    -   To diagnose a revenue dip, understand the funnel steps and identify where the dip occurred, considering platform and user segments.
    -   A/B testing involves creating a control group and a treatment group, selecting a metric to measure, calculating a sample size, and comparing the results to determine if the feature performed better or worse.
    -   Choosing the right metric is crucial when running A/B tests, as financial metrics are often too noisy and require a larger sample size to accurately measure.
    -   Choose a metric higher up in the funnel to reach sample size faster, and pick low variance metrics such as orders per user to measure conversion.
    -   When conducting A/B tests, it is important to select a sample size and not peek at the results until reaching that sample size, while also considering seasonality and understanding that well-designed experiments take time.
-   📊 A/B testing is important but external factors can skew results, being data-driven is important but product management also requires judgment and risk-taking, and it's important to track metrics and consider potential consequences when implementing new features.
    -   A/B testing is a messy but necessary way to measure the impact of new features, but external factors can skew the results.
    -   It's a costly myth that if you can't measure it, you can't manage it, and while being data-driven is important, product management also requires judgment and risk-taking.
    -   When implementing a new feature, it is important to consider the potential consequences and impacts on other parts of the business, and to track metrics such as orders per user and price per order to ensure consistency across all categories.
    -   The speaker discussed the difficulties in analyzing technical issues with different devices and screen sizes, as well as the challenges in manipulating content representation, and suggested looking at referrals to increase traffic.
    -   Acquisition is the most important metric for a growing startup, while comparing features of a service versus a product falls under design and strategy rather than just analytics.
    -   There are various tools available for data analysis such as SPSS, Tableau, SQL, and Redshift.
