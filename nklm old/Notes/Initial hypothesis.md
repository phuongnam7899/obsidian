# Defining
- The essence of the initial hypothesis is ==“Figure out the solution to
the problem before you start.” ==
- Example: Suppose you have to drive to a restaurant in a part of town you
don’t know. You know you have to make the third left off Smith
Street and then take the first right; it’s just after that corner. You
know how to get to Smith Street; you’ll just follow your directions
from there. Congratulations, you have an initial hypothesis.
