> Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send

- Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.
- Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.
- The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.
- Accept variable input from users, translating that input to meet your requirements, defining boundaries for input, and providing clear feedback to the user.
