# Why sapiens rule the world

Sapiens rule the world because ==only they can weave an intersubjective web of meaning==: a web of ==laws, forces, entities and places== that exist purely ==in== their common ==imagination==. This web allows humans alone to organise socialist revolutions and human rights movements.
